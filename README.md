The explosive emergence of decentralized and distributed technologies (otherwise known as "blockchain" technology) has given way to a flood of new talent entering the ecosystem. As a result, new industry-specific apps and programs are being released on a daily basis. Our team noticed that one of tne of the most common needs these developers have is to simply have access to an exhaustive library of good quality, systematically labeled, and properly formatted cryptocurrency asset icons...

It is for this reason that the Crypto Photos project exists and aspires to be the most complete collection of high quality cryptocurrency asset icons on the internet!

# FORMATTING & SYNTAX

All source photos are formatted as <i>.PNG</i> and are sized at exactly <i>300x300 px</i>

All photos displayed on the project website are rendered at <i>150x150 px</i>

### Search by asset symbol's first letter

To view all asset icons beginning with a specific letter of the alphabet, simply navigate to the index of that letter by using the URL format below: 

```
http://crypto.photos/x
```
where "x" is the letter of the alphabet that you wish to search.

### Search for assets with non-alphabetic first characters

To vew all asset icons which begin with non-letter characters, navigate to the following URL: 

```
http://crypto.photos/num
```

### Direct logo icon linking

To link directly to a specific icon use the following format:

```
http://crypto.icon/x/xyz.png
```
where "x" is the first letter of the asset symbol, and "xyz" is the <i>lowercase</i> asset symbol. Be sure to add the file type (.png) onto the end.
